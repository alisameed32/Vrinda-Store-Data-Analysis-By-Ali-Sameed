Objective:

The Vrinda store aims to create an annual sales report for 2022 to understand its customer base better and drive more sales in 2023.

Project Description:

As part of this investigation, I looked closely at the Vrinda Store's sales figures for 2022. Several important steps were incorporated in the project:

1. The initial stage of data processing involves obtaining and classifying unprocessed sales data from multiple sources.
2. Data cleaning is the process of fixing errors, filling in blanks, and guaranteeing data correctness.
3. Analyzing data to find patterns, trends, and important variables influencing sales.
4. Data visualization is the act of providing insights by creating visual representations of the data.
5. Creating user-friendly interactive dashboards to display the results is the fifth step in creating reports (interactive dashboards).
6. Gaining Understanding from the Data: Gathering information to enable Vrinda Store to make judgments based on facts

Important Takeaways:

1. Customer demographics: Of all Vrinda Store visitors, women make up over 65% and are the most likely to make a purchase.
2. Geographic Distribution: The top three states, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, account for more than 35% of total sales.
3. Age Group Analysis: The bulk of sales contributions are made by adults between the ages of 20 and 49.
4. Sales Channels: The two primary online shopping behemoths that propel sales are Amazon and Flipkart.

Conclusion and Suggestions: 

In light of the data, I advise Vrinda Store to concentrate its marketing efforts on Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra women between the ages of 20 and 49. Maximizing reach and engagement with this target group on Amazon and Flipkart requires a prominent display of advertising, special offers, and coupons.
