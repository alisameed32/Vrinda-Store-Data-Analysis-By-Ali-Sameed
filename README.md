# Vrinda-Store-Data-Analysis-By-Ali-Sameed

Objective:

The Vrinda store aims to create an annual sales report for 2022 to better understand their customer base and drive more sales in 2023.

Project Description:

I thoroughly examined the sales statistics from Vrinda Store for the year 2022 as part of this study. The project included a number of crucial steps:

1. Gathering and organizing raw sales data from various sources is the first step in the data processing process.
2. The process of removing mistakes, handling missing numbers, and ensuring data accuracy is known as data cleaning.
3. Examining data to identify trends, patterns, and significant factors affecting sales.
4. The process of delivering insights through the development of visual data representations is known as data visualization.
5. Creating Reports (Interactive Dashboards): Making interactive dashboards that are easy to use to show the results.
6. Gaining Insights from the Data: Compiling data to let Vrinda Store make data-driven decisions.

Important Takeaways:

1. Customer demographics: Female customers are the most likely to make a purchase, accounting for over 65% of all Vrinda Store visitors.
2. Geographic Distribution: More than 35% of total sales are accounted for by the top three states, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.
3. Age Group Analysis: Adults between the ages of 20 and 49 account for the majority of sales contributions.
4. Sales Channels: Amazon and Flipkart are the two main e-commerce giants that drive sales.

Conclusion and Suggestions: 

In light of the data, I advise Vrinda Store to concentrate their marketing efforts on Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra women between the ages of 20 and 49. Maximizing reach and engagement with this target group on Amazon and Flipkart requires a prominent display of advertising, special offers, and coupons.
